NetDocuments is an online document repository where you can store, access, and share your documents. Using NetDocuments, access any document within NetDocuments anywhere in the world as long as you have a connection to the Internet and a web browser. Mobile applications for use with NetDocuments are also available from both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

Before using NetDocuments, we recommend a user's workstation is set up with all the correct NetDocuments applications and settings to ensure their NetDocuments experience is seamless. Read our Setting Up a New User Workstation article for more information.

NOTE: NetDocuments takes measures to ensure our products are generally compatible with popular screen readers such as Microsoft’s Narrator, JAWS, and NVDA.

NetDocuments Home Page
The NetDocuments Home Page is the page you normally start with when you log into NetDocuments.

Select the menu button and the Navigation pane pops out as an overlay, so your content isn’t narrowed to make room for it. A pin icon keeps the Navigation pane displayed.
Hover over Documents to have one-click access to either your Recent or Favorite documents.
Hover over Matters to have one-click access to either your Recent or Favorite Matters pages.
Select the ellipse button to get to Advanced Search options.
Quick Search is at the top of the page for fast access to find your important documents.
Whether creating a new document or uploading documents into NetDocuments, select the Add button.
Go to User Profile drop-down menu to update your account and workstation settings, view online Help, and log out when finished with your session.
Select Go to a matter and start typing a client or matter number — the type-ahead functionality does the rest.
Select Customize Layout to organize your content.
Drag items right where you want them.
Starred workspaces appear in Favorite Workspaces.
Starred items appear in Favorite Items.


The Navigation Pane
The Navigation pane on the left is used to access cabinets, workspaces, and folders:

To navigate to a workspace, select the arrow next to any cabinet in the list where you can see both recent and favorite workspaces:

Then, select your desired workspace to display the contents.

My Email
Under a workspace that you are viewing in the navigation panel, you will see an option called My Email:
This option is a quick way to view emails in the selected workspace which were imported, sent, or received (such as To: or Cc:) by the logged-in user. This is useful in capturing emails that were imported by someone else (e.g., a legal assistant) or which were imported by the signed-in user but sent to someone else (e.g., if I’m the legal assistant).
Using this option is the same as running the following search criteria in the advanced search:
"Q":"(=17( %CU% ) OR =18( %CU% ) OR =19( %CU% )) OR (=6( %CU% ) AND =11(msg OR eml) )

Field 17 is: Email To
Field 18 is: Email Cc
Field 19 is: Email From
Field 6 is: Imported By

The My Email option is available for convenience so that users do not have to run a search every time they wish to see emails that fit the above criteria.

NetDocuments Structure
NetDocuments is a content or document management system (DMS) that organizes your various files and objects on the NetDocuments Platform. Some terms to understand include:

Repository - It represents your organization’s account. User accounts are added to the repository level, such as employees. Organizations can have multiple repositories.
Cabinet - The container that houses folders and workspaces. User access is usually granted on the cabinet level.
Workspace - A view that displays a client’s documents. It is organized into sections called folders, saved searches, or filters. You often file items in the cabinet but do NOT file them in any folder. They appear in the workspace instead.
Folders and Subfolders - A container that houses your documents. Folders can have subfolders.
CollabSpace - A container that behaves similar to a workspace, used to share documents with your clients and other external parties. When CollabSpaces are enabled, external users cannot be added to any location other than a CollabSpace.
Document - A Word, Excel, or PDF document. Documents can have multiple versions, with one version designated as Official.
Official Version and other versions - One document can have multiple versions; Of those versions, one is designated as the Official version or the document that is the one to use, such as the latest version.
